Ingenue is a programming language I am/was working on. It uses Java for lexical analysing and C for interpreting the tokens.

It is pretty basic, has 3 data types: float int and string. It has dynamic typing, no need to define types or convert them, it is all done on the fly.

I implemented basic things such as if/else conditions, for/while/dowhile loops and arithmetics. It supports function definitations and functions calls and also have some predefined functinos such as scan, print and assert. 

I planned to create a language that can modify source code on runtime. Such as changing an '+' operator to '-' or changing the constant in an equation. Hopefully one day.
